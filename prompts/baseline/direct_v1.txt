CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: NUMERICAL CLASSIFICATION TASK

You are functioning as a precise classification system. Your ONLY task is to analyze the input data and return a single numerical classification result.

CLASSIFICATION PARAMETERS:
- Valid output range: 0 to {num_classes_minus_1} (inclusive)
- Classification mapping: {class_mapping}

STRICT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Your response MUST contain EXACTLY ONE digit
2. The digit MUST be within the range 0 to {num_classes_minus_1}
3. NO additional text, explanations, or commentary is permitted
4. NO punctuation marks, spaces, or special characters
5. NO line breaks or formatting
6. NO acknowledgments or confirmations

CLASSIFICATION PROCESS:
1. Carefully analyze the provided input data
2. Compare the input against each class definition in the mapping
3. Determine which class best matches the input characteristics
4. Select the corresponding numerical identifier (0-{num_classes_minus_1})
5. Output ONLY that single digit

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT OUTPUT FORMAT:
- If classification result is class 0: Output "0"
- If classification result is class 1: Output "1"
- If classification result is class 2: Output "2"
- And so on...

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT OUTPUT (DO NOT DO THIS):
- "The answer is 2" ❌
- "2." ❌ 
- "Class 2" ❌
- "Based on analysis: 2" ❌
- Any text before or after the digit ❌

ERROR PREVENTION:
- Double-check that your output is a single digit
- Verify the digit falls within 0-{num_classes_minus_1}
- Ensure no extra characters are included
- Do not provide reasoning or explanation

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Before submitting your response, confirm:
□ Output is exactly one character
□ Character is a digit (0-9)
□ Digit is within valid range (0-{num_classes_minus_1})
□ No additional text or formatting present

Remember: ANY deviation from these instructions will result in classification failure. Your response must be PRECISELY one digit corresponding to the appropriate class.

FINAL REMINDER: Output format = Single digit only (0-{num_classes_minus_1})
